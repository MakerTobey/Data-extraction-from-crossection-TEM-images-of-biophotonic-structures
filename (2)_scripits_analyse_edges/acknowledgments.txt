The external Matlab peakdet function (http://www.billauer.co.il/peakdet.html) was used, ans each surface element was resampled with the algorithm interparc (by John D’Errico  2012, downloadable from MathWorks File Exchange). Additionally, the Research Gate community and colleagues helped solving some of the most difficult processing steps, especially Karl Christoph Goedel, Jörg Schleicher, and Jan Vanek. https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_to_analyze_curved_image_edges_in_Matlab, https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_to_fit_curves_to_non-continuously_differentiable_series_of_data_points/3.
